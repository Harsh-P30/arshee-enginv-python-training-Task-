## What is NumPy?

- NumPy (Numerical Python): A Python library for numerical and scientific computing.

- Provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on them.

- Faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.

## Why Use NumPy?

- Performance: Operations are faster because NumPy uses optimized C code.

- Convenience: Provides built-in functions for math, statistics, linear algebra, etc.

- Multidimensional arrays: Handles data structures more efficiently than nested lists.
